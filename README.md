# Elementail
This is a personal project I created while I was in 12th grade. It provides detailed information about chemical elements. By entering the atomic number, symbol, or name of an element, you can retrieve information about it.

The project consists of nearly 1500 lines of hard-coded data and uses the EasyGUI library to create the interface. All the data related to the elements is sourced from various websites.

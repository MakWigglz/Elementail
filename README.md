###   This repo. is forked (cloned to my machine too) from "Elementail" by a boy wonder of 12 years old, it is 
   basically an incomplete periodic 
   table in Python if else elif statements. Boy wonder indeed, he did it at 12. 
   
###  Now I, who wasted my younger genius years chasing Love, fun, and ladies, and now at 50 after being rejected by my new "mon amoure", who 
  
   was  a very fancy lawyer my 
  partner hired....Now all this pain, heartache, and lost years and potential, are the fuel that keep me on my desk 
   almost 20 hours daily learning all that there is to become a full stack programmer and data analyst, web 
   application creator. 
   
###   This new repository will be for a Python Map Game loosely based on the the periodic table of natural elements, with major additions, in an SQL database, of physics, including the standard model, chemistry, astronomy, biology, history, politics and war....this massive data base, which also includes Kabbalah and the Tree of Life, and personal development, in two formats: one as an anclyclopedia of knowledge in tidbits, fractals we call them, with visual links and maps, and the second is the game format, specifically designed for a bunch (few hundreds) of rich lazy friends who would enjoy a massive mind map game that teaches them something. 

####   Purpose is to showcase personal evolving skills, and to practice, because I want to build Apps that can do magic with Data Sets, practical insights that guide profitable decision making.

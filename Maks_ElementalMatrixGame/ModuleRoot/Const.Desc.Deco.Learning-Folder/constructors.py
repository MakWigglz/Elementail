# Here's how constructors work in Python:
# 1. The __init__ Method: The constructor in Python is defined using the __init__ method within a class. This method is automatically called when an object of the class is created. The __init__ method typically takes at least one parameter, usually named self, which represents the instance being created.Additional parameters can be defined to pass values to the constructor during object creation.

# Initializing Attributes:
# Inside the __init__ method, you can initialize the attributes of the object using the self   keyword. This allows you to set initial values for the attributes based on the parameters #  passed the constructor.

# Creating Objects:To create an object (instance) of a class, you use the class name followed by parentheses (). Any arguments passed inside the parentheses are passed to the __init__ method during object creation.

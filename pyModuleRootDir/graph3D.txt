The selected code is a Python script that uses the `matplotlib` library to create a 3D scatter plot. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. **Imports:**
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
   ```
   - `matplotlib.pyplot` is imported as `plt`, which is a common convention. It provides a MATLAB-like interface for plotting.
   - `Axes3D` is imported from `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`, which is necessary for creating 3D plots.

2. **Defining Points:**
   ```python
   a = (1, 2, 3)  # Replace these with your actual coordinates
   b = (4, 5, 6)
   ```
   - Two points, `a` and `b`, are defined with 3D coordinates. These are the points that will be plotted in the 3D space.

3. **Creating a Figure and 3D Axes:**
   ```python
   fig = plt.figure()
   ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
   ```
   - A new figure is created using `plt.figure()`.
   - A 3D subplot is added to the figure with `fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')`. The `111` is a subplot grid parameter that means "1x1 grid, first subplot".

4. **Plotting the Points:**
   ```python
   ax.scatter(*a, color='r', label='Point A')
   ax.scatter(*b, color='b', label='Point B')
   ```
   - The `scatter` method is used to plot the points `a` and `b` in the 3D space.
   - `*a` and `*b` unpack the tuples into separate x, y, and z coordinates.
   - `color='r'` and `color='b'` set the colors of the points to red and blue, respectively.
   - `label='Point A'` and `label='Point B'` provide labels for the points, which will be used in the legend.

5. **Adding Labels and Legend:**
   ```python
   ax.set_xlabel('X')
   ax.set_ylabel('Y')
   ax.set_zlabel('Z')
   ax.legend()
   ```
   - `set_xlabel`, `set_ylabel`, and `set_zlabel` add labels to the x, y, and z axes, respectively.
   - `ax.legend()` displays a legend on the plot, using the labels provided in the `scatter` method.

6. **Displaying the Plot:**
   ```python
   plt.show()
   ```
   - `plt.show()` renders and displays the plot in a window.

7. **Overall, this script creates a simple ``` 3D scatter plot with two points,      labeled and colored differently, and displays it with axis labels and a legend.

Based on the provided snippets and project structure, I'll provide you with a pseudocode outline and some suggestions to get started with your project. Let's begin by integrating the ten topics into the existing code and then outline the steps to build the project.

First, let's update the `TopicModelSQLiteDB.py` file to include the ten topics:

**File: /Users/amakki/Documents/Coding-Design/GitHub/empty for Github clones/Maksportfolio/MaksPortfolio/Elementail/Elementail/Maks_ElementalMatrixGame/ModuleRoot/Docker/firstDraft_subModule/SQL Database module/TopicModelSQLiteDB.py**
```python
import sqlite3
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to the SQLite database
connection = sqlite3.connect('enlighten.db')
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Create the TopicModel table
cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS TopicModel (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        title TEXT,
        content TEXT,
        source TEXT,
        url TEXT,
        image_url TEXT,
        date_added TEXT,
        last_updated TEXT
    )
''')

# Define the ten topics
topics = [
    "Science",
    "Technology",
    "Engineering",
    "Mathematics",
    "Art",
    "History",
    "Geography",
    "Music",
    "Literature",
    "Sports"
]

# Insert the topics into the database
for topic in topics:
    cursor.execute('''
        INSERT INTO TopicModel (title, content, source, url, image_url, date_added, last_updated)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
    ''', (topic, f"Content for {topic}", "Initial Source", f"https://example.com/{topic.lower()}", 
          f"https://example.com/{topic.lower()}.jpg", datetime.now().isoformat(), datetime.now().isoformat()))

# Commit the changes and close the connection
connection.commit()
connection.close()
```

Now, let's create a pseudocode outline for building the project:

```
1. Set up the development environment
   - Install Python, Flask, and required dependencies
   - Set up a virtual environment

2. Initialize the database
   - Run the TopicModelSQLiteDB.py script to create the database and insert initial topics

3. Create the Flask application (backEnd.py)
   - Set up routes for:
     - Fetching all topics
     - Fetching a specific topic
     - Updating a topic
     - Deleting a topic
   - Implement CRUD operations using SQLite

4. Create the frontend (front-end.html and Tree.1.js)
   - Set up the HTML structure
   - Implement the 3D tree using Three.js
   - Create event listeners for branch interactions

5. Implement the Tree class
   - Create methods for initializing the tree
   - Add branches corresponding to the ten topics
   - Implement branch click handling

6. Style the application (styles.css)
   - Design the layout for the 3D tree
   - Style individual topic pages

7. Integrate frontend and backend
   - Use AJAX to fetch topic data from the backend
   - Update the UI dynamically based on user interactions

8. Implement additional features
   - Add user authentication and progress tracking
   - Integrate external APIs for additional content

9. Test the application
   - Perform unit tests for backend functions
   - Test frontend interactions and responsiveness

10. Containerize the application (dockerfile.py)
    - Create a Dockerfile for the application
    - Set up Docker Compose for easy deployment

11. Document the project
    - Update README.md with setup and usage instructions
    - Add comments to the code for better maintainability
```

To start building the project, follow these steps:

1. Set up your development environment by installing Python, Flask, and other required dependencies.

2. Create a new Flask application in `backEnd.py` and implement the basic routes for fetching and manipulating topic data.

3. Set up the SQLite database using the `TopicModelSQLiteDB.py` script we created earlier.

4. Create the frontend HTML file (`front-end.html`) and start implementing the 3D tree visualization using Three.js in `Tree.1.js`.

5. Implement the `Tree` class in JavaScript to handle the creation and interaction with the tree branches.

6. Style your application using CSS (`styles.css`).

7. Integrate the frontend and backend by making AJAX calls from the frontend to fetch topic data.

8. Continuously test your application as you build it, ensuring that both the frontend and backend work correctly.

9. Once the basic functionality is working, you can start adding additional features like user authentication and external API integration.

10. Finally, containerize your application using Docker for easy deployment.

Remember to update the `README.md` file with instructions on how to set up and run your project as you progress.
